# LangChain-Text-Processing-and-Extraction-Demo
This project demonstrates two powerful LangChain techniques using OpenAI's language models:  
* Create Stuff Documents Chain: Processing and extracting information from multiple documents 
* Create OpenAI Function Runnable Chain: Converting natural language into structured data using function calling

# Features

* Uses LangChain with OpenAI's GPT-4 model
* Implements two different chain types for different use cases
* Demonstrates document processing and structured data extraction
* Environment variable management for API keys

# Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* LangChain
* OpenAI API key
* Pydantic
* python-dotenv

# Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
```python
openai_apikey=your_openai_api_key_here
````

# Run the script with Python:

```bash
python chain.py
```
